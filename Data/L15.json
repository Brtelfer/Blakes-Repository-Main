Because as we have seen on the previous page, and also the title, Turandot is introduced as a main character.  From these text signals, we know that the story is going to be about her.",
        "As we found out at the end of this page. # The prince of Persia was beheaded, so he is probably not going to show up anymore. # The correct answer is actually Turandot. # Because as we have seen on the previous page, and also the title, Turandot is introduced as a main character. # From these text signals, we know that the story is going to be about her.",
        "One might argue that Turandot came up with really hard riddles, that might indicate her intelligence. But it is not known from the text where she got the riddles from. # So we don't actually know much about her intelligence. The answer is actually C. As the second to the last sentence in this section mentions, Princess Turandot is vengeful, which was where her absurd requirements for her suitors came from.",
        "Turandot did warn the Prince of Tartary to change his mind withdraw, but that is a consequence of the actual major problem in the story, which is described in choice B. # As we have also read previously, the Prince of Tartary is in love with Princess Turandot, but in order to marry her, he must also attempt the riddles that her previous suitors have failed. # And in doing so, he is putting his own life in danger.",
        "There is no mention in the story so far that what Turandot is doing is lawful. # As we've seen, she is making her suitors answer her riddles out of revenge, therefore the correct answer is C.",

        "This page shows that the Prince's maid is in love with the prince, but there was no suggestion that the prince returns her love.

If she finds out his real name, she can not only not marry him, but kill him as she planned before.",
        "The answer is actually C. As the text shows, the Prince of Tartary made Turandot fall in love with him also, and gave her his name as a testament of his devotion to her.",
        "The answer is actually B. Yes, as with many romantic narrative stories, this story put unconditional love as the ultimate solution to cruelty and vengeance. As some people might say, love conquers all things.",

As shown in the text, Viola is in a bit of trouble since she's so good at wooing the countess for the duke that the countess fell in love with her instead, thinking she's a man.  Then she married Viola's twin brother since they look exactly alike. Sebastian just went along with it.",

        "The correct answer is actually C. As the princess said to the evening star, she prefers the Evening star as a human, and will have him as a mortal, nothing more.  This also indicates that she does at least care about how she can end up with the Evening star.",
        "The Creator mentioned that if the Evening Star asks him something else, he could give him dominion over all lands and sea.  But from this page, we found out that the Creator of the Evening Star rejected his request.  So the correct answer is actually A.",

The answer is actually Sea.  The Creator explained that the Evening Star is different from a living thing in that the Evening Star will not die, but instead will be the wonder of all time.",

As the end of the story shows. The Evening Star did not fall again for the princess. He has accepted the separation of realms between them. The princess also fell for Catalin, who is the incarnation of her earthly soulmate.",

The Evening Star also recognized that the mortals are different from him in that they can change quickly based on luck, whereas he is constant and eternal."
