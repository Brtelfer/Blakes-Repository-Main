        "The topic of this text is sensationalizing crime reporting.  This is when the media makes an act of crime seem worse or more horrific than it actually was.",
        "The main argument of this text is that sensationalizing boosts sales.  The more interesting or horrible the news is, the more likely people will be to buy the newspaper.",
        "The correct answer is, false, weak descriptors are used more.  It is more common for writers to use more neutral words in the media than outright negative words.",
        "From this text, we learn that the media uses ways other than descriptors to sensationalize crime.  Using strong language is not the most important way media outlets sensationalize.",
        "Reporters focused on the youngest shooting victim because it appealed to the emotions of the readers.",
        "The writer thinks that reporters benefit from focusing on the youngest shooting victim because it boosts sales for the media outlet.  When readers have an emotional reaction to what they are reading, they are more likely to continue following the story in the future which increases the readership of the platform.",
        "Take a look at this part of the text.",
        "Alright.",
        "Using emotions makes people want to learn more about a story.  By making the story more emotional, people are more inclined to follow it after they initially hear about it.",
        "The writer is suggesting that readers can ask themselves these questions in order to determine whether the crime is being sensationalized or not.  It is important for readers to be aware of sensationalizing so they can look more closely to find all the facts of an event rather than just what the media focuses on.",
        "The topic of this text is eating bugs or in other words, edible insects.  During this lesson, I will use both words, bugs and, insects.",
        "The writer is for, this topic.  The writer is persuading the reader to consider the health and global benefits of eating insects.",
        "One reason people should eat insects is because they are healthy.  They contain lots of vitamins and minerals that other meats do not have.",
        "Bugs are healthy because they are low in fat and high in protein.  They also have low levels of cholesterol.  Cholesterol blocks the flow of blood to your heart which can cause heart attacks.  Lots of foods are high in cholesterol but bugs are not.",
        "The writer might include information about other cultures eating bugs in order to convince us that it can become a norm in our society too.  There are cultures all over the world that consider it normal to eat insects so there should not be a stigma associated with it.",
        "This sentence is not considered important information.  It is, however, a supporting statement.  It supports the writer's statement that insects are tasty.",
        "Bugs are less expensive to produce than traditional livestock supports the writer's argument that bugs are economical, or, cost-efficient.  Insects can be grown and raised in much smaller spaces and they consume fewer resources during their growth period than say, a cow, does.",
        "The writer might include information about safe, clean, and all-natural insects to appeal to those who are conscious about what they eat.  Not that most of us want to eat dangerous food, but it reassures us that they have stringent health and safety standards when it comes to the large-scale production of insects.",
        "The writer includes information about future plans to show the reader that the organization is moving forward.  This can include the fact that the organization is established and not going to go away.  This promotes the organization's integrity and its social and economic standing.",
        "The topic of this text is fracking.  As we read in the text, fracking is a way of extracting oil and natural gas from deep underground.",
        "The writer is trying to convince us that fracking is dangerous.  One way we can tell that this is a very important argument is that it is included in the title.",
        "Fracking exploits communities for business profit supports the writer's main argument that fracking is dangerous.",
        "The text tells us that one reason fracking is dangerous is because it can pollute nearby water sources.  Water used in fracking is full of pollutants such as sand and toxic chemicals.  This is very dangerous to the environment and humans living near these sites.",
        "This sentence supports the writer's argument because it is elaborating on how it can pollute nearby water.  This sentence is giving examples of how these chemicals pollute surrounding waterways.",
        "Fracking increases the amount of pollution in an area.  It has a negative impact on the air in surrounding communities because it contains pollutants related to diseases.  Toxic dust clouds travel through the air and permeate nearby cities.",
        "This part of the text is suggesting that fracking can lead to very serious illnesses in communities near fracking sites.  These diseases can cause serious harm to people living in these communities.",
        "In this section of the text, the writer is suggesting that fracking overall is dangerous to communities.  This is because of the massive social and economic repercussions of polluted air and water, and the need for more expensive emergency and social services.",
        "Between economic wealth and public health, fracking has serious trade-offs.  While it might help to boost the economy of an area it might also have an adverse effect on the environment and public health."
