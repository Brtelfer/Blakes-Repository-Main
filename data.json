"Assertion": [
    "The word orbit refers to something that goes around an object. In this case our Earth orbits the sun meaning it goes around in a circular journey around the sun.",
    "the word convenient means easy to use or suits your plans. Since it is easy to compare other orbits to Earth distance is referred to as one astronomical unit.",
    "The word normally means usually or regularly. We usually or regularly mean 24 hours when we say the word day.",
    "the word terrestrial means that something is related to Earth.",
    "The word organism refers to something that is living such as humans or animals. Earth is the only known planet to have living things.",
    "To flourish means to grow or develop. They have found creatures that have grown and developed successfully in an environment.",
    "To be barren means to not produce crops or life. So a planet that is barren has no life on it.",
    "Abundance means having a large amount. Since 70 percent of the earth is water, there is an abundance of water on Earth. There is a large amount of water on Earth.",
    "Essential means to be very important and necessary.",
    "Partially means to be incomplete. So Earth’s atmosphere has a protective layer that almost blocks UV radiation.",
    "Sprawling means to cover a large area in an untidy way. So, here we learn that galaxies cover large areas of the universe and they can appear untidy.",
    "the word consist means to be made or formed from two or more things. So the Milky Way Galaxy is made of a flat disk and spiral arms.",
    "Bulging means that something looks larger and rounder or fuller than normal. So, the Milky Way Galaxy is made up of or consists of a flat disk that has a large and round center with spiral arms.",
    "galactic can be defined by the enormous size of an object. Galaxies consist of stars, planets, dust, and gas all of which rotate around the enormous center in a regular manner.",
    "Distinctive means that something is easy to recognize or see because it is different from other things around it. The spinning motion caused by the rotating of the matter in the galaxy causes the disk to take on a recognizable spiral shape. The spiral shape is different from the other shapes seen in the galaxy.",
    "elongated refers to something that is longer or thinner than usual. Elliptical galaxies may be circular or so thin that they look like a cigar!",
    "interstellar matter can be referred to as matter that is found between the stars.",

    "To spawn means to cause something to be produced or exists.",
    "Plentiful means to have a lot of something available. There is a lot of matter available in the center of the galaxies.",
    "The word enormous means extremely large. If there is a lot of material available in the center of the galaxies then they grow to be extremely large.",
    "The word observational. Observational refers to the something is carefully watched and learned from. If scientists cannot see black holes they cannot learn from them.",

    "that was great! So saying I normally say hello to others means I usually say hello to people.",
    "Great job! So terrestrial is something from earth, so we are terrestrials because we live on earth.",
    "user, I had a feeling you picked the right definition. Awesome! so people are organisms because we are living things.",
    "Awesome that was the right definition for flourish. So flourish means to grow or develop. Like flowers! They grow!",
    "I knew that was the right answer! So land can be barren when there is not life! So the desert may be considered barren because people cannot live out there",
    "Ok. So when something is abundant there is a large amount. So to have an abundance of cupcakes means I have a large amount of cupcakes.",

    "I thought this was the correct answer! An example is a forest, A forest is sprawling because it covers a large area!",
    "So that's what that means when people ask, what did your day consist of! They are asking what was my day made up of. I thought so.",
    "user, Great you picked the right definition! So for example my backpack bulges when it is too full of stuff.",
    "I knew that was the right definition! A galactic book means that the book is enormous! I think I'm understanding it.",
    "I thought that was the right answer! So something is distinctive if it stands out or looks different, like an 18 wheeler. 18 wheelers are distinctive trucks because they are larger and different than the smaller cars we are used to seeing.",

    "Ok, that answer makes sense. I get it now. So when the moon orbits the earth it goes around it. Got it!",
    "Oh I thought you picked the wrong definition. So being easy to use is what convenient means. So is that why some stores are called convenient stores, you can find things easily and they have almost anything you could think of.",
    "Gotcha, so you did pick the right definition for the word normally. So saying I normally say hello to others means I usually say hello to people.",
    "looks like I was wrong! So terrestrial is something from earth. so we are terrestrials because we live on earth.",
    "I was totally wrong. so people are organisms because we are living things.",
    "So flourish means to grow or develop. Like flowers! They grow!",
    "Now I understand. So land can be barren when there is not life! So the desert may be considered barren because people cannot live out there",
    "So when something is abundant there is a large amount. So to have an abundance of cupcakes means I have a large amount of cupcakes.",
    "ok. now i see. So When something is essential it is very important and necessary. So water is very essential or important for people to drink.",
    "Oh shoot. I was totally wrong! So partially means something is not complete. So when people say to partially fill up your gas tank that means to fill it up but not completely.",
    "I see how i was wrong. I thought sprawling meant injure yourself because sprawl rhymes with fall.",
    "Ok. that answer makes sense. So consist means to be made of something, like a car is made up of an engine and tires.",
    "I see! Something bulges, like my backpack, when it is fuller than normal.",
    "Oh I see! So for example if something is galactic it is enormous. A galactic building is an enormous building.",

    "user, I guess you picked the right answer after all! To elongate a muscle means to stretch it out or make it longer. Now I understand the definition.",
    "I see. So something is interstellar if it is between stars, like a spaceship!",
    "Oh ok, that answer makes sense. So an organization of stars as well as galaxies can be found in space.",
    "I was wrong! Interact doesn't mean to act or acting. It just sounds like it.",
    "I knew that was the right definition for merge. An example of something that merges together would be lanes on the expressway. Like galaxies, these lanes combine together to make one lane.",
    "Oh I think I understand. So when I collapse, that means that I've fallen down. All of this is starting to make sense!",
    "Looks like I was wrong. Relatively is used when you compare things, so like comparing flowers to dirt, flowers smell relatively better than dirt, meaning flowers smell better overall when compared to dirt.",
    "I thought you picked the wrong definition! So for stars to be dense, that means they have a lot of material that is close together.",
    "Ok. It looks like I was wrong, black holes consume or use up dust from the galaxy like us when we consume or use up food for energy.",
    "I see. So black holes populate the universe just like people when they populate a city.",

    "Sorry, I guess that was the right answer! Something is plentiful when there is a lot of it.",
    "user, Okay so you were right! So enormous means really extremely large, so the sun is enormous because it is really large.",
    "I guess I was wrong but now I get it. So If you do not carefully observe or watch how someone plays an instrument you cannot learn how to play yourself. I get the idea.",
    "I guess you were right correct. Emit means to release like a blow dryer emits heat and a light bulb emits light."
